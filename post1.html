        The greatest lie ever told

          The greatest lie ever told is that we have innate abities.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took to math and coding - especially games - as a kid. But when I tried to make art for my games, it was awful. My parents would see my scrawling and nod. "You're not an artistic type," they would say.
        </p>
        <p>
          We split the world into dichotomies. Fuzzies and techies. Creative and technical people. It's common knowledge that crossing from the side you're on to the other is hopeless.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn't true.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took me a long time to figure this out. The belief that I was 'just a technical person' was so strong that I didn't realize I could step outside of that label. I didn't understand it was a label. I thought it was truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          The amount of skill that you have in a certain area is proportional to the amount of work that you put into it. 
          There is no such thing as a 'creative' or 'technical' type. 
          The reason I was bad at art starting out is the same reason we are bad at <em>anything</em> starting out.
          As soon as I started putting hours of practice, I got better.
          To be clear, I don't deny that people may enjoy one subject more than another, which could have a confounding effect. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This realization was life changing. I can be good at anything that I dedicate myself to.
       </p>
        <p>
          What restrictions have others placed on you?
