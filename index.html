        The greatest lie ever told

          The greatest lie ever told is that some people are predisposed to things, and some aren't.
        </p>
        <p>
          I took to coding and math really fast as a kid. My sisters were more creative types. I would try to make art for my games, but I just couldn't make it look good. My parents would see my attempts and nod. "You're not an artistic type," they would say.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not true.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took me a long time to figure this out. The belief that I was 'just a technical person' was so strong that I didn't realize I could think otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The amount of skill that you have in a certain area is proportional to the amount of work that you put into it. 
          There is no such thing as a 'creative' or 'technical' type. 
          The reason I was bad at art starting out is because we are bad at <em>anything</em> starting out.
          It's as simple as that.
          To be clear, I don't deny that people may enjoy one subject more than another, which could have a confounding effect.
