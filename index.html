        Hi! If you're here looking for a main blog wall, well, it doesn't exist. I didn't actually expect to get any hits from the hackernews post, and that was my first blog post here. Still, thanks for the interest. You can contact me at (my github repo name)@gmail.com.
        </p>

    <div class="footer">
      Words written by <a href="http://twitter.com/thedayturns/">Grant Mathews</a>. You may use my permutation of these words only for Good, not Evil. You can use my CSS for both- but seriously, good luck.
